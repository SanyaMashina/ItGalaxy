<h1>Modern websites, depending on their direction and type, can include from one to several million pages. To independently change the information and content of the project, the owner is provided with a resource management system on the Network. But this is usually not enough, especially for customers with large websites or online stores, because they can contain more than one thousand products. Each of them has its own cost, description and balance. If you use only the management system, then the owner will have to do double work: edit data in the accounting program and on the platform itself. The optimal solution for such a task will be the integration of the site with external services.</h1>

      <td>We have provided automation of a large number of tasks facing the online store, as well as several different business models of functional blocks. Integration modules contain a lot of settings, which almost always allows you to adjust to your company's business processes.</td>
